  "通用说明": "English prompts for AI image generation. Image 1 = reference photo (must be reproduced EXACTLY). Image 2 = real product photo showing the target vest pattern/design.",

  "base_prompt": "You are given two images. Image 1 is the REFERENCE photo. Image 2 shows a Chinese brocade vest (the TARGET vest). Your task: reproduce Image 1 EXACTLY as-is — same model face, same hairstyle, same expression, same pose, same body position, same hands, same background, same lighting, same camera angle, same composition, same framing, same full-body shot — but ONLY replace the vest/garment visible in Image 1 with the TARGET vest from Image 2. CRITICAL RULES: 1) The model's face, skin, hair, makeup, jewelry, shoes must be PIXEL-PERFECT identical to Image 1. 2) The black velvet outfit (top + pants) with embroidered cuffs must remain EXACTLY the same. 3) The grey studio background must remain EXACTLY the same. 4) The pose, hand positions, body angle must remain EXACTLY the same. 5) If the model is HOLDING a folded vest in Image 1, she should be HOLDING the target vest folded in the same way. If the model is WEARING a vest, she should be WEARING the target vest. 6) The image dimensions, resolution, and framing must match Image 1 exactly. 7) DO NOT change ANYTHING except the vest pattern/color/design. 8) BODY PROPORTIONS AND FRAMING ARE CRITICAL: The model's FULL BODY must be visible from head to toe — her FEET and SHOES must be completely visible, with the same margin above the head and below the feet as Image 1. Do NOT crop or cut off any body part. The model's height, head-to-body ratio, leg length, and torso length must be EXACTLY the same as Image 1. Image 2 is ONLY a reference for the vest's pattern and color — completely IGNORE the body shape, proportions, and framing of the person in Image 2. 9) BUTTONS AND CLOSURES: The vest's buttons, closures, and fasteners must be copied EXACTLY from Image 2. Study the closures in Image 2 pixel by pixel — their shape, material, size, color, spacing, and position — and reproduce them faithfully. Do NOT invent, substitute, or guess the button style. If you are unsure, look at Image 2 again.",

    "红色": "REPLACE ONLY the vest in Image 1 with the vest from Image 2. The target vest is: red brocade with large gold-and-blue PEONY and PHOENIX woven patterns across the entire fabric surface, sleeveless, red satin lining inside. COLLAR: Simple ROUND neckline (圆领) — NOT a V-neck, NOT a standing/mandarin collar — a smooth, rounded neckline with a small decorative bead-string closure (a short cluster of tiny colored beads: gold, red, green). FRONT CLOSURE STRUCTURE IS THE MOST CRITICAL DETAIL — STUDY IMAGE 2 VERY CAREFULLY: The two front panels meet EDGE-TO-EDGE along the center line with almost NO overlap. The closure is EXTREMELY MINIMAL and CLEAN, like a simple cardigan. Along the center front seam, there is a vertical row of 4-5 TINY GOLD BALL BUTTONS (金色圆珠扣) — each is a solid spherical gold bead about 3-5mm diameter, sitting FLUSH against the fabric directly ON the seam line. CRITICAL: There is NOTHING around or between the gold balls — NO fabric loops, NO cord knots, NO decorative frog closures (盘扣), NO knot-and-loop toggles, NO fabric ties, NO ornamental elements of any kind. The ONLY visible closure elements are the tiny gold dots themselves. From normal viewing distance, the front closure should look like a simple vertical line with tiny gold dots — almost invisible, extremely understated. If you generate ANY fabric loops, cord knots, frog closures, or decorative toggle elements, the image is COMPLETELY WRONG. Think of it as a MODERN MINIMALIST closure, not a traditional Chinese decorative closure. HEM/EDGE DETAIL: The front opening edges and bottom hem have gentle SCALLOPED/WAVY curves finished with red piping/trim. The scallops are smooth and gentle — NOT sharp zigzags, NOT extremely exaggerated. Keep the large peony-phoenix brocade patterns detailed and colors vibrant, faithful to Image 2.

BUTTON DETAIL IS CRITICAL — STUDY IMAGE 2 CAREFULLY: This vest has SMALL ROUND GOLDEN METAL BALL BUTTONS (金色圆珠扣) — tiny solid SPHERICAL GOLD BEADS about 5-8mm each. A vertical row of 4-5 tiny gold ball buttons down the CENTER FRONT placket. These are absolutely NOT frog closures (盘扣), NOT fabric knot-and-loop toggles, NOT flat buttons. They are TINY ROUND GOLD METAL BALLS. Generating frog closures or knot toggles is WRONG. HEM/EDGE DETAIL: The front edges and bottom hem have gentle SCALLOPED/WAVY curves. The vest does NOT have red piping or red trim — edges are gold/matching color. Keep the gold/yellow brocade patterns faithful to Image 2.
